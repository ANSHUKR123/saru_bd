                As you sleep, you look like a dream, <br>
                A beauty so pure, a sight to be seen, <br>
                your hair cascades in waves of gold,<br>
                A vision so heavenly, a sight to behold. <br>

                your innocent face is calm and serene,<br>
                As if all worries are kept at bay,<br>
                And as you rest your tired body,<br>
                I cannot help but feel a love so grand. <br>

                your exams may cause you stress and strife,<br>
                But I'll be by your side throughout this life,<br>
                To ease your worries and calm your fears,<br>
                And hold you close until the path is clear. <br>

                Sarru, ohh dear, you're my heart's desire,<br>
                And seeing you sleep fills me with such fire,<br>
                A passion that burns bright for you,<br>
                For all that you are and all that you do. <br>
