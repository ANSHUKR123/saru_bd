            Happy birthday, my dear Saurnika! Today, as we celebrate the day you came into this world, I want you to know just how special you are to me. You've touched my heart in ways I never thought possible. From the moment we connected on Discord, our conversations have been filled with laughter, understanding, and an undeniable connection. You've shown me what it means to truly care for someone, and I am grateful for every moment we've shared.

Through the ups and downs, you have been my rock, supporting me and guiding me with your love and kindness. Your presence in my life has brought me so much joy and happiness. Your dedication and resilience during your exams, despite the challenges you faced, inspired me to be a better person. Your beautiful soul shines through even in the darkest of times, and I am honored to be by your side.

Saurnika, you are more than just a friend to me. You are the person who makes my heart skip a beat, who understands me like no one else, and who has filled my life with love and warmth. Your shyness and hesitations only make you more endearing to me, and I admire your strength and beauty, both inside and out.

On this special day, I want to assure you that my feelings for you are unwavering. You have my love, support, and unwavering commitment, no matter what the future holds. I am here to cherish and protect our bond, and I hope we can continue to create beautiful memories together.

Saurnika, may this birthday be the beginning of an incredible year filled with joy, success, and love. Thank you for being the amazing person you are. Happy birthday, my dear Sarruu, Priye, Priyassi, and Dhakkan. I love you with all my heart."
